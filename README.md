This README file provides an overview of this GitHub project, which is to create a personal website to showcase my projects. The website will include information about me, my skills, my portfolio, and my contact details. The website will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive design. The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages and will be updated regularly with new projects and features.
